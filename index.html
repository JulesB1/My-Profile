		<h1>Intro to IT: Assignment 1 – My profile</h1>

			<h2>Personal snapshot</h2>

			<img src= "pics/2999AC0185755556813_P.jpg" alt="Jules" width="200" height="250">

			<p>Name: Julian Bayley</p>
			<p>Student ID: s3915785</p>
			<p>Student email: s3915785@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

      <p>I come from an English-speaking family of English & Australian
				ancestry. I have two siblings, a brother and sister (both older)
				and live with my partner in Moonee Ponds. We recently adopted a cat,
				named Molly.</p>

      <img src="pics/20210214_192648.jpg" alt="Molly" width="150" height="250">

      <p>I have completed VCE as well as a Certificate 3 in Customer Contact,
				done as part of a workplace training program during some prior
				employment.<p/>

      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy computer gaming and gardening.
				I also enjoy Dungeons & Dragons (3.5ed preferred) however unfortunately,
				 these days- and especially during a pandemic, don’t get many
				 opportunities to play.</p>

			<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
			<p>My interest in IT stems from how it connects to, and impacts on, so
				many aspects of our lives. The internet has enormous functionality and
				potential, however also potential for misuse- for that reason cyber
				security seems like an increasingly necessary discipline in these
				times.</p>

			<p>I think my interest was piqued when cybersecurity started to become a
				more household term, due to an increased occurrence of cyber crime
				against both public and private organisations and an increasing number
				of large-scale cyber security events, such as the SolarWinds hack and
				the compromising of Microsoft Exchange email servers etc.</p>

			<p>My own IT experience has been relatively limited. Professionally, I
				have previously worked as a complaint resolution subject matter expert
				(SME) in telecommunications customer service; IT allowed me to interact
				with and assist colleagues via direct communication and engage in
				knowledge sharing and collaboration. I was also able to assist customers
				 by doing things like performing remote service tests for network
				 faults or checking the suitability of their service plans by analysing
				 their usage history and patterns etc. Outside of work I use IT for
				 communication, information and recreation.</p>

			<p>I chose to study at RMIT due to having heard good things about the
				organisation from previous students and, also, simple convenience- it
				is the closest university to my home, which means less time travelling
				to and from campus.</p>

			<p>I expect to learn a combination of practical skills and technical
				knowledge, regarding not only various fields of IT but also navigating
				challenges in the professional world. I may also gain some insight
				into my own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

			<h2>Ideal Job – Cyber Security analyst</h2>

			<img src="pics/cyber_security_analyst_2.jpg" alt="job_description">

			<p>I believe my ideal job would, currently, be as a cyber security
				analyst. The role itself would likely include tasks such as;</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Security and network auditing,</li>
				<li>threat research and analysis,</li>
				<li>staff education and security protocol training,</li>
				<li>network monitoring,</li>
				<li>incident investigation and response</li>
				<li>installation and configuration of security software</li>
				</ul>

			<p>Due to the seemingly pervasive need for IT security, and projected
				growth within the industry itself, the role would offer a good level of
				job security while also offering an opportunity to be involved with
				different work within an organisation. Analyst roles also seem to be
				reasonably well paid.</p>

			<p>I tend to appreciate roles that offer variety, learning and a degree of
				challenge (as they are all things which help to prevent becoming bored).
				A need for staying up to date with industry subject matter and
				expertise- such as security testing techniques- and learning about
				associated roles within the industry may help to make an analyst more
				thorough. Such learning may also provide inspiration for potential
				further career development. All these things would likely help me
				remain focused and engaged in my role, which is another factor in my
				consideration.</p>

			<p>The position would likely require tertiary qualifications (and
				possibly industry certifications), well developed communication skills
				and a strong knowledge of cyber security itself
				(and associated IT skills); knowledge of types of security threats
				(malware, spyware, hackers etc) and their prevention, mitigation and
				countermeasures, knowledge of industry related hardware, software,
				network configurations and infrastructure, relevant laws and risk, data
				and security management policies or frameworks. Depending on the role
				itself, prior industry experience may also be required.</p>

			<p>Due to experience in complaints resolution as well as consultant
				support, I believe I currently possess strong communication skills. To
				be considered for a cyber security analyst role I would need to gain
				qualifications, IT and cyber security knowledge and skills- I may also
				need industry certifications and industry experience, depending on the
				role and employer.</p>

			<p>Completing the Bachelor of IT with a focus on IT security would,
				hopefully, equip me with a strong foundation of the necessary knowledge
				and skills while also providing me with qualifications and allowing the
				opportunity to attain further industry certifications (probably
				starting with CompTIA Security+). Obtaining employment in the field,
				even in an entry level role, would then allow me to begin to gain
				experience that I may need to consider further certification (CISSP)
				and/or to be considered for a “senior” role (within the industry) or a
				greater role within the organisation.</p>

			<h2>Personal Profile - Testing</h2>

			<h3>"16 Personalities" test</h3>

				<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/ba12d1d81feae">16 Personalities Test result</a>

				<ul>
				<li>Type:	Turbulent Adventurer</li>
				<li>Code:	ISFP-T</li>
				<li>Role:	Explorer</li>
				<li>Strategy:	Constant Improvement</li>
			  </ul>

			<h3>Learning style test</h3>

			<p>http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/</p>

				<ol>
				<li>Your primary learning style – Reflector (51%)</li>
				<li>Secondary learning style – Pragmatist (21%)</li>
				<li>Tertiary learning style – Theorist (21%)</li>
				<li>Quaternary learning style – Activist (6%)</li>
				</ol>

			<h3>Primary style - Reflector</h3>

			<p>“Reflectors prefer to stand back and observe. They tend to be cautious,
				preferring to take a back seat. They like to collect and analyse
				information to help them reach their conclusions, which they may take
				considerable time and effort to develop. Reflectors see the big picture
				by using information gathered from previous experience as well as the
				here and now.”(LifeTrain, Learning styles quiz)</p>

			<h3>Leadership style</h3>

			<p>https://eml.usc.edu/leadership-style-quiz</p>

			<p>“You know how to be genuine and present during interpersonal
				interactions. You have the emotional intelligence to feel empathy and
				you know how to express it. Your authenticity means you are generous
				and share yourself with others. Storytelling is one of your strengths;
				it is how you connect with people and engage them in a shared vision.
				Perhaps your biggest gift is the ability to empower the people around
				you to achieve their best.”(USC Price School of Public Policy, 2021)</p>

			<h3>Results & insight</h3>

			<p>More recently, I have found I am less confident and a bit more
				uncertain of the future. These results (especially the Myers-Brigs)
				offer confirmation of change in my personality (reflected in current
				and previous results). I have begun to place greater value on
				communicating and connecting with my family and friends. I suspect
				these changes have stemmed from some previous impacts to my health and
				changes in my occupation while also being influenced by wider events
				such as COVID-19.</p>

			<p>When I completed my personality test previously, I was working as a
				SME and was confident in my working knowledge. Now, as a student and a
				member of a team, I believe I will be more open to outside ideas and
				team discussion (compared to previously) however may be hindered in
				such discussions by reduced self-confidence. This may also result in
				being less argumentative and/or perhaps taking on a more mediatory role,
				in the event of team disagreements.</p>

			<p>When forming a team, ostensibly I would need to be mindful of my own
				communication style to ensure success in communication and contribution.
				Ideally, I should form a team with similar people that complement my
				personality and learning types (those more open to group discussion)
				however if that does not occur, to be mindful of how I need to
				communicate and the potential communication barriers I may experience
				if teamed with people with more assertive personality or leadership
				types.</p>

			<h2>Project Idea – "History augmented"</h2>

			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>A mobile application designed to complement a user’s
				experience of visiting a site of historical or natural significance by
				displaying a graphical representation related to the nature of the site
				itself (and often based on the user’s physical location). When looking
				around the site via the mobile app, the user would be able to view a
				graphical interpretation of the site’s history; be it buildings,
				historical figures or battles etc. Users could then get further
				information or interact with the content by tapping on the items
				displayed.</p>

			<h3>Motivation</h3>

			<p>History can be interesting however often many historical sites may be
				in a dilapidated state (some may be literally ruins) or just completely
				bare or empty (such as battlefields), meaning a visitor must rely on
				imagination and additional reference materials to fill in the gaps.
				uring a recent trip to Port Arthur, I was a bit disappointed by how
				little of the site actually remained- the tour offered further
				information which could be accessed via mobile so I got to thinking how
				it would be much more immersive to even just be able see what the
				buildings looked like, their distance and placement to each other in
				the town etc, in order to get a better feel for life in the work colony
				at the time.</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>

			<p>“History Augmented” would operate as a mobile based application using a
				variety of data to display content related to the site the visitor was
				attending. By loading the application and downloading the site content
				pack, the user would be able to view the site and see various content
				related to its history. They would be able to choose the types of
				content to be viewed, how it would be arranged and how it could be
				accessed. Content could range from simple photos and sprites to 3D
				images anchored to specific GPS coordinates, along with text and sound.
				By tapping the images, the user would be able to access additional
				information and notes of the site’s significance or initiate a display
				of various content related to the item tapped. Users would also be able
				to take photos and videos of the area viewed, inclusive of the augmented
				reality content, to create interesting comparisons of “before and after”
				or even just creative and fun shots to remember the visit with.</p>

			<p>The content itself would be able to be accessed in a few different
				methods; a traditional and straightforward menu, haphazardly in a “free
				mode” where content appears based on the user’s progress through and
				around the site and/or location and proximity to features (if the
				content was location based) or they could initiate a “tour” which would
				prompt them on where to walk and where to face (again, using location-
				based services and data) and displaying content at pre-programmed areas
				or intervals.</p>

			<p>The types of content, as mentioned, would depend on the type of site
				being visited however, ideally, would include 3D images. Ruins of
				cultural sites or towns could be digitally reconstructed and displayed,
				allowing the user to walk through or around the structures, granting a
				much better perspective for comparison and visualisation of the size and
				scope of their construction and the materials used. Battlegrounds could
				display images and information about the combatants, such as battlefield
				placement, formations, types of units, equipment and weapons used etc.
				The battles themselves could even be brought to life and played out in
				mock fashion, showing significant moments of the battle, depictions of
				key personnel such as generals, officers or soldiers of renown etc.
				However, content would not be limited to man-made features or places of
				significance- it could also be included for natural sites such as
				national parks, significant natural sites such major forests, rivers and
				volcanoes or sites linked to discoveries (such as fossils etc), allowing
				visualisations of examples of specific flora and fauna native to the
				areas or even flora and fauna now extinct, such as dinosaurs. It could
				also be used to display simulations of natural disasters such as fires,
				floods or volcanic eruptions in areas of their significant occurrence
				(be it either man-made or natural sites).</p>

			<p>Ostensibly, the biggest limitation on the content would be the means
				of creation itself as well as the hardware and system requirements to
				display and access content when ensuring compatibility to a range of
				user devices.</p>

			<h3>Tools and technologies</h3>

			<p>The app would require a smartphone with general features such as a
				camera, touch screen, high bandwidth internet connection and sufficient
				storage for the content pack. Ideally it could have both an Android and
				IOS version (however this would likely result in higher production
				complexity and costs). Depending on the content pack, the app itself
				may need to draw on local location data but the augmented reality
				content (the visual and audio data) would be included in the packs
				(downloaded separately to the app). The content packs would require
				audio, graphics and location data to be created (perhaps via a platform
				like Amazon Sumerian<sup>1</sup>(Aran Davies, DevTeam.Space) or
				Vuforia<sup>2</sup>(Program-Ace, 2021)) or sourced separately.</p>

			<p>The main app would then need to load and integrate the associated data,
				however this aspect may be assisted by or performed with existing
				platforms such as, Google Play for AR (ARCore)<sup>3</sup> (Google, 2021) or
				ARKit<sup>4</sup>(Apple, 2021).</p>

			<h3>Skills required</h3>

			<p>A useable end-product would require programming of the main app, as
				well as content packs. Audio and visual data would need to be captured
				or created, indicating a need for multimedia skills and location data
				would need to be sourced or captured for relevant sites. All of the
				data would then need to be compatible with the main application.
				Furthermore, information regarding the history of the site would also
				need to be sourced, likely from relevant historical, scholastic or
				tourism groups (perhaps in conjunction with any parties interested in
				using the finished product). Close and regular communication between
				parties interested parties and those involved in production would need
				to be maintained throughout each project, so communication and project
				management skills would likely be quite beneficial. The product would
				also require advertising or marketing and distribution via platforms
				like Google Play or IOS App Store.</p>

			<p>Each of the above aspects and requirements already occurs within IT and
				augmented reality industries however, more than likely, each aspect
				would need to be completed independently which would most likely
				increase production costs and complexity and mean production needs to
				be more closely managed and completed with close adherence to design
				criteria.</p>

			<h3>Outcome</h3>

			<p>Success of the project would require the completed technical
				production as well as the uptake of the finished product by interested
				parties- should both of these be achieved, the project should help to
				create better and more interesting experiences when visiting historical
				sites (or any site for that matter) where AR content packs are
				available. It may help to improve the overall experiences that people
				have and in turn have flow on benefits such as in increase in tourism
				and attendance to sites where the AR content is available.</p>
